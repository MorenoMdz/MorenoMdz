### Hi there! 

I am Moreno, father of two amazing kids, tech guy whos been working with technology since I was 16 years old. 

I have been writing software solutions since 2014 when the need to develop a system to manage my own shop client orders came up. After that I decided to get a second degree, this time in Software Engineering, and software development has been my main focus since.

### My stack

My current stack is focused in React, React native, NodeJS and Typescript. I have solid experience developing systems with Firebase and Express.
